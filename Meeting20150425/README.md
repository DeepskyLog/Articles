# DeepskyLog meeting April 25, 2015

[DeepskyLog](http://www.deepskylog.org) is a free web-application to keep observation logs and drawings of deep-sky objects and comets. DeepskyLog also helps you to prepare observing sessions. DeepskyLog is a large online deep-sky database containing more than 75,000 observations and more than 10,000 drawings.
We will organize a DeepskyLog developer day (location still to be decided, but certainly in Belgium) where we will discuss the plans for the future. This meeting is also a good moment to look for extra contributors.

We are looking for:
* Software developers (php, mysql)
* Android / iOS app developers
* Testers
* Translators (to make DeepskyLog available in different languages)
* Documentation (writing articles, documentation, making movies, ...)
* Deep-sky specialists to clean up, check and expand the object database

I think it is clear that you don't need to be a software developer to make some contributions to DeepskyLog. If you are interested in helping, just let me know. It is possible to participate in the meeting using skype or google hangouts.

## Time and location

The DeepskyLog meeting will take place on April 25, starting at 9:00. 
The meeting will take place in the Van Hoof Room (03.34) of the Institute of Astronomy of the KU Leuven. More information on how to get to the Institute of Astronomy: [http://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/visitors](http://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/visitors)
