# Things to discuss during next meeting

+ Catalogs: 
  + Should they be generated automatically? Now we have a lot of catalogs in the list, somethings also the first part of the common name.
  + Provide more catalogs?
  + DeepskyLog does not have a suitable object type for galaxy groups. "galaxy cluster" is generally 30+ or 50+ galaxies. See also issue 409. (SkyNomad)
+ Issue 472: Double locations
